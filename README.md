# randompyscripts
Just random Python scripts I cobbled together in my free time. There should be some neat things here...

Obligatory CYA text below:

If you want to use or modify these scripts, do so. I don't really see why they are useful for anything, but you do you. The only thing I request is a credit to me (Tyler Amick), a link to this repository (randompyscripts), and the name of the script you used (ex: dec2bin.py).

THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY ON ANYTHING IN THIS REPOSITORY (randompyscripts). I AM ABSOLUTELY NOT LIABLE FOR ANYTHING THAT OCCURS AS A DIRECT OR INDIRECT RESULT OF THE USE OF THIS REPOSITORY (randompyscripts) OR ANYTHING IN THIS REPOSITORY (randompyscripts).
